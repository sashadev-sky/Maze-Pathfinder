# Maze Solver

- A Maze Solver I built in Ruby, to be used in the terminal console

## Overview
- I have provided a maze tester "maze1.txt"
- To run the pathfinder, simply enter `ruby maze-classes.rb` in your terminal console

#### Pending
- Add more mazes

### Notes
- if the maze has no initial moves, it will tell you there's no path
- if has moves but then finds its unsolvable, it will print as far as it got - otherwise you will always get the fastest path according to the A* algorithm



#### Ruby Concepts
(for my own purposes)
- `colorize` gem
- Reversing a grid to have graph perspective
- `File` class I/O
- Computer pathfinding
- Overriding `to_s`
- `send` method
- `hash` deep dup
